## Click, Click, Click

How good is your memory?   [Test it](https://jawilmer.github.io/ClickClickClick/) with _Click, Click, Click_, a full-stack web application built with React. The app randomly renders images to the screen, keeping track of their clicked state -  true or false - depending upon weither they have been selected by the user.   The user's score increases as new images are clicked.  The game ends if an image is selected twice.  Sound easy?  There's a twist - each time an image is clicked, all of the images are shuffled and their locations are randomly changed.
